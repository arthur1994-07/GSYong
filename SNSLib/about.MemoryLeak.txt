It's not definitely lost, but only reachable on application's exit. You can 
see from the backtrace that the memory is allocated in the system libraries, 
not in libcurl. I don't think it's a bug even there if the memory is not 
growing during application's life time. And these functions should be called 
only once.

For example on Fedora 11 libcurl uses NSS for SSL. Once you call PR_Socket() 
you have possible lost 48B. But if you call PR_Socket() in the loop, it 
doesn't grow.
